# Arrhythmia classification using ML/DL techniques

In this project, we assess various ML/DL Approaches for Cardiac
Arrhythmia classification on the MIT-BIH dataset. Our objective is
to offer an effective and time-saving ECG analysis solution by
combining signal processing techniques with efficient deep
learning models.
