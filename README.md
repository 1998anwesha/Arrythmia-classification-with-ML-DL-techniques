# Arrhythmia classification using ML/DL techniques

In this project, we assess various ML/DL Approaches for Cardiac
Arrhythmia classification on the MIT-BIH dataset. Our objective is
to offer an effective and time-saving ECG analysis solution by
combining signal processing techniques with efficient deep
learning models.


## Dataset
MIT-BIH is a publicly available dataset. It can be found here [link](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0)
